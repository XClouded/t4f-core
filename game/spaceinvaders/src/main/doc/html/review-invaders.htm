      <b><font face="Times New Roman">SPACE INVADERS ANNIVERSARY
      (PS2: Taito/ Japanese import) <br>
      Bought from <a href="http://www.play-asia.com/">www.play-asia.com</a> for 
      about  £9 (inc shipping)<br>
      (UK release early April 2004,  £9.99 inc shipping from

            <p style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10" align="justify"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Sometimes, you can 
            get nostalgic for the days when there was no retrogaming. Ever since 
            the release of Williams Arcade Classics on PC and Mac a decade ago - 
            the event which marked the real start of the retro phenomenon we 
            know today, though it wasn't strictly the first commercial 
            retrogaming product - awakened software publishers to the 
            cash-milking potential of their forgotten old software, we've been 
            subjected to a drip-feed not of the greatest or most interesting 
            games from the proud and varied history of gaming, but largely to 
            endless repackagings of the same tiny handful of well-worn 
            "classics". Asteroids and Missile Command, Defender and Robotron, 
            Pac-Man and Galaxian - fine and seminal games all, but every one of 
            them has been retro-released in at least half-a-dozen different 
            packages across a dozen formats. </span></p>
            <p style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10" align="justify"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Meanwhile, a vast 
            galaxy of equally-deserving games, even from the same publishers, 
            remain lost and unresurrected. Namco's "Museum" series on the PS1 
            commendably started out by including obscure gems alongside the 
            blockbusters, but latter releases in the franchise gave in to the 
            marketing men and the mainstream, and you're more likely to get five 
            Pac-Man variants and five Galagas on a Museum disc now (and none of 
            the beautiful "virtual museum" presentation of the first six 
            compilations, either).</span></p>
            <p style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10" align="justify"><span style="font-size: 11pt">At least the 
            inherent cheapness of the software business has been eroded a little 
            over the retro years, though - the days of skeletal retrogaming 
            packages featuring just four or five ancient games have faded away, 
            with releases like Midway Arcade Treasures offering a beefy 20-odd 
            titles, including some rarities, and featuring games from much 
            closer to the modern era as well as the really vintage stuff. Space 
            Invaders Anniversary, on the other hand, is like a trip back in time 
            - not to the era of the original Space Invaders arcade game, but to 
            the old days of retro. It's retro retro, if you will. What?</span></p>

            <font style="font-size: 11pt" face="Times New Roman">Space Invaders 
            Anniversary (released to commemorate 25 years since the first arcade 
            Invaders game changed the cultural face of the world) revisits the 
            days of retrogaming in both good and bad ways. On the good side, the 
            games in this compilation are presented in a slick 3D environment 
            reminiscent of the first Namco Museums - an authentically 
            backstreet-looking little virtual Japanese arcade packed with 
            variously-styled Invaders coin-ops which you can walk up to and slide a virtual coin into, and 
            in which (unlike any arcade this writer has ever visited, sadly) 
            there's also a little library of historical memorabilia, in the form 
            of old flyers, technical documentation, and a filmed interview with 
            the game's creator, Toshihiro Nishikado. (Sadly, in your reporter's 
            Japanese import version, all of this archive material is in 
            Japanese, with no subtitles or anything, so you'll have to wait for 
            the UK release to find out how interesting it is.) </font></p>
            <p style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10" align="justify">
            <font style="font-size: 11pt" face="Times New Roman">In a neat 
            innovation, Anniversary even lets you choose how close you want to 
            stand to the virtual machines in its cheaply-decorated pretend 
            arcade - you can play the games close up, as if with your face 
            pressed against the glass for the very best view of the invaders 
            themselves, or you can step back a little and take in the pretty 
            cabinet artwork while you blast the bad little space guys. And in 
            another nice touch, the normal sounds of your play are also 
            accompanied by the ambient background noise of other people in the 
            arcade playing Invaders (or, more oddly, any of several other Taito 
            coin-ops) - though when you finish your game and turn to look for 
            them, you're mysteriously alone.</font></p>
            <p style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10" align="justify">
            <span style="font-size: 11pt">On the downside, Space Invaders 
            Anniversary also retreads some of the bad old days of retro. This 
            virtual arcade has just nine machines in it, and only five of those 
            are distinct games - Space Invaders and Space Invaders Part II (in a 
            few differently-coloured variations), and three games which as far 
            as this reviewer knows were never coin-ops: Space Invaders Doubles 
            (the basic Invaders, but with two players playing at once, and which 
            you need a second joypad for, there being no option for a CPU 
            buddy); Space Invaders VS, a weird-looking head-to-head battle game 
            (in which you CAN play against either the CPU or a human opponent), 
            and Space Invaders 3D, a modernised version&nbsp; with Tron-esque 
            wireframe 3D graphics, a couple of minor powerups and a wide range 
            of viewpoints, all the way down to one where you see the invaders 
            from right inside your Laser Base, which looks fantastic but is 
            insanely hard to play from.</span></p>
            <p align="center">
            <img src="review-invaders_files/inv2.jpg" border="0" height="378" width="540"><br>
            <font size="2"><b><i>Just about the lowest viewpoint in 3D Mode that 
            you can sensibly use.</i></b></font></p>
            <p style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10" align="justify">
            <span style="font-size: 11pt">Anniversary also reflects the negative 
            aspects of commercial retrogaming in what it <i>doesn't</i> include. 
            For one thing, these appear to be simulations, not emulations - and 
            low-res simulations at that, which is a bit of a shame given the 
            power of the PS2. The machine could easily have rendered these 
            games in photorealistic graphics, with dramatic lighting effects and 
            reflections and all the rest of it. Instead, the graphic resolution 
            on the vintage games is barely up to SNES standards - at any of the 
            more distant viewpoints, the invaders are just indistinct blobs, and 
            laser shots so hard to see that the games verge on unplayable.
            </span>
            </p><p style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10" align="justify">
            <span style="font-size: 11pt">Secondly, of course, there are
 all the 
            other Space Invaders games that aren't included here. For a 
            quarter-century celebration, you'd think Taito might have 
taken the 
            trouble to organise a proper family reunion. But where's 
Space 
            Invaders II, the rare two-player cocktail-table VS game from
 1980? 
            Where's the first true colour sequel, Return Of The Invaders
 (1985)? 
            Where's the brilliant Super Space Invaders/Majestic Twelve 
(1990)? 
            Where's 1994's Space Invaders DX, which featured much of the
 content 
            of Anniversary plus a cool new hi-res "Parody Game" version 
of classic SI 
            featuring other Taito game 
            characters as the invaders? Where's the funny, cartoony 
Space 
            Invaders '95? Where are novelties like Prize Space Invaders,
 a 
            cash-payout coin-op from 1990? How cool would it have been 
            if you could have played it in the virtual arcade, then used
 the money to buy little virtual collectable toys (like in Shenmue), 
            historical Invaders memorabilia and merchandise, or unlock 
extra 
            games (like the official handheld/keyring/LCD versions, 
maybe) or 
            some of the documentary materials? </span>
            </p><p style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10" align="justify">
            <span style="font-size: 11pt">Perhaps it's not fair to expect such 
            high-end content and qualities in a game released in Japan for the 
            equivalent of less than a tenner, of course (naturally, the UK RRP 
            is twice that high, but it's available to pre-order on the web for 
            pretty much the Japanese price - see the link at the top of the 
            page). But for such a significant birthday, wouldn't it have been 
            nicer to see a truly definitive, high-resolution, all-inclusive and 
            comprehensively-documented history of the most important videogame 
            of all time, even if that meant paying normal price?&nbsp; </span></p><p align="center">
            <img src="review-invaders_files/inv3.jpg" border="0" height="378" width="540"><br>
            <font size="2"><b><i>VS Mode appears to be all about shooting the 
            Mystery Ship (not pictured).</i></b></font></p><p style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10" align="justify">
            <span style="font-size: 11pt">This review hasn't - as alert readers 
            may have spotted - actually mentioned Space Invaders the game yet. 
            Partly because if you don't know what Space Invaders is about by 
            now, you've almost certainly come to the wrong website by mistake, 
            but also because, let's face it, the game isn't really the point of 
            releases like this. This is the gaming equivalent of a coffee-table 
            book, really aimed not at gamers but at the sort of people who like 
            to decorate their shelves with tasteful and "classic" artefacts and 
            get agitated and unhappy if they don't own all of Mojo's 100 
            Greatest Ever Albums, even the ones by Captain Beefheart that nobody 
            in the world has ever actually played all the way through. (Or at 
            least, not while they themselves were in the room.)</span></p><p style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10" align="justify">
            <span style="font-size: 11pt">Nevertheless, it's worth pointing out 
            in passing that Space Invaders is actually still a pretty good game. 
            Although the first couple of waves give the impression that it's 
            going to be dull, plodding and easy, Space Invaders ramps up the 
            difficulty hard and fast, and you're going to need reactions, 
            strategy and forward planning if you're going to get some high 
            scores, or even reach the 10th level, where the relentless march of 
            the invaders ever-closer towards your defence bunkers at the start 
            of each wave is temporarily relieved. (Thankfully, and unlike 
            several unforgivably-dismal recent retro compilations whose 
            developers should be eaten by wolves, Space Invaders Anniversary 
            DOES give you the opportunity to save your high scores to the memory 
            card, giving you something to play for every time you load it up.)</span></p><p style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10" align="justify">
            <span style="font-size: 11pt">But on the whole, despite the cheapo 
            sub-£10 
            price (which gets SIA a significantly higher mark than it would 
            otherwise deserve), this is a disappointing release - a missed opportunity to do 
            something really good, passed over for the chance of a few quick 
            pennies. Very few games will ever achieve a status as iconic as 
            Space Invaders, and it's a bit of a shame not to see the old stager 
            treated with something more approaching the dignity it deserves. 
            Maybe the 50-year anniversary edition will do the job properly.</span></p><p style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10" align="justify">
