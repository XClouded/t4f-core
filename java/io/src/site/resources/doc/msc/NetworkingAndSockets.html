<h1>Networking and Sockets</h1>
<h2> 1. Networking basics</h2>
<h3> 1.1 Hosts and ports</h3>
To use the services of a host on the network, a program needs to
identify that computer. &nbsp;Internet hosts are identified by an <i>IP
address</i> consisting of four 8-bit unsigned numbers (called <i>octets</i>),
usually given in decimal separated by periods.&nbsp; (IP stands for
Internet Protocol.)&nbsp; Because numeric addresses are difficult for
people to remember, the internet Domain Name Service associates host
names (e.g., <code>ernie.cs.uic.edu</code> ) with IP addresses (e.g., <code>131.193.40.40</code>).<br>
<br>
The class <code>java.net.InetAddress</code> encapuslates an internet
host&#8217;s name and IP address. &nbsp;<code>InetAddress</code> has no
public
constructors: you obtain an instance with the class messages <code>getAllByName</code>
or <code>getByName</code>, which contact the internet domain name
services to resolve a host name to its IP address or vice versa.&nbsp;
The argument is a string giving either an internet name or an IP
address. &nbsp; (<code> getAllByName</code> is used when a host has
multiple IP addresses, e.g. because it is connected to multiple
networks, and it returns <code>InetAddress[]</code> .) &nbsp;For
example:<br>
<code> &nbsp; &nbsp;InetAddress rtfm =
InetAddress.getByName("rtfm.mit.edu");<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;InetAddress tigger =
InetAddress.getByName("128.248.155.51");</code><br>
<code>getAllByName</code> and <code>getByName</code> signal an <code>UnknownHostException</code>
if the host name cannot be resolved or a <code>SecurityException</code>
if the security manager does not allow the program to resolve that host
name. &nbsp;The class message <code>getLocalHost</code> returns an <code>
InetAddress</code> representing the machine on which the virtual
machine is running. &nbsp;The accessors <code>getHostName</code> and <code>
getHostAddress</code> return the internet name and IP address,
respectively.&nbsp; The class <code>InetAddress</code> also defines <code>equals</code>,
<code>hashCode</code>, and <code>toString</code>.<br>
<br>
Typically, a computer has a single physical connection to the network
through which data destined for that machine arrives. Since data
arriving over that connection may be intended for various applications,
the operating system needs a way to route data to the correct process.
&nbsp;<em></em> A <i>port</i> is a virtual address on an internet host
identified
by a 16-bit integer.&nbsp; (It is not the same as a hardware port.)
&nbsp;Ports allow a host to provide multiple services that are
available remotely.&nbsp; <i>Well-known ports</i> are port numbers
that are assigned by convention for specific services. &nbsp;Examples
include port 21 for FTP servers, port 23 for telnet, and port 25 for
SMTP (simple mail transfer protocol),
and all well-known ports have numbers less than 1024. &nbsp;Data
transmitted over the Internet includes addressing information that
identifies the host by its 32-bit IP address and the port by its number.<br>
<br>
<h3>1.2 Protocols</h3>
TCP (Transport Control Protocol) is a <i>connection-oriented protocol</i>
built on top of IP which establishes a reliable point-to-point
connection between the source and destination that remains in effect
until closed.&nbsp; It ensures that all the packets in a message are
delivered and are received in the correct order. &nbsp;TCP
error-detection and error-correction features allow the source and
destination to treat the connection as a byte stream.&nbsp; For
example, FTP, SMTP, DNS, NNTP (net news), and HTTP are built on top of
TCP.<br>
<br>
UDP (User Datagram Protocol) is a <i>connectionless</i> protocol built
on top of IP that does not establish a link between the source and
destination, and does not guarantee the order of the packets in a
message or even whether individual packets are delivered. &nbsp;If a
message consists of several packets, the recipient must reconstruct the
message.&nbsp; The advantage of UDP is that it requires much less
overhead than TCP because there is no hand-shaking, no retry if an
acknowledge isn't received, no buffering and numbering of packets, etc.
&nbsp;Connectionless protocols typically are used either for one-packet
messages for which delivery is not crucial, e.g. responses to time
requests, or to reduce the transmission overhead for
time-critical data that can be lossy, such as streaming audio or
continuous measurements.<br>
<br>
The package <code>java.net</code> includes classes for both
connection-oriented and connectionless communication. &nbsp;We will not
cover connectionless communication in detail.<br>
<br>
<h3>1.3 Sockets</h3>
Sockets are an interprocess communication mechanism originally defined
in BSD 4.x UNIX that support communication between processes on
different
computers. &nbsp;A <em>socket</em> is one endpoint of a two-way
communication
link between two processes running on a network. &nbsp;Sockets are used
in pairs, one for each of the communicating processes. &nbsp;A <i>socket
address</i> consists of a IP address and a port number so that the TCP
layer
can identify which process should receive the data.<br>
<br>
Client-server socket usage is not symmetric: the server is running and
the client requests a connection to it. &nbsp;Typically, IPC systems
define two types of sockets: a <i>server socket</i> for handling
connection requests and a <i>client socket</i> for transmitting and
receivng data. &nbsp;A
server socket provides a network-accessible service which &#8220;listens&#8221;
for requests on a particular port number. &nbsp;The client's operating
system usually assigns the port number for a client socket, which the
server receives when its operating system recognizes and establishes a
connection
from the client. &nbsp;When the operating system on the server machine
recognizes a message for its IP number, it resumes the server process
associated with that port (if necessary), and begins a session (for a
connection-oriented protocol), which creates a client socket for the
server to use to send and receive messages to and from the client's
socket. &nbsp;Usually, the server process begins a new process (in
Java, a new thread) to handle that connection so that it can continue
to service other clients (which is why the operating system creates a
new socket for the connection on the server side). The
session continues until the server or client closes the connection.<br>
<br>
UNIX uses the same <code>read</code> and <code>write</code> system
calls for sockets that it uses with files and pipes. &nbsp;As with
those streams, these calls are syunchronous: <code>read</code> blocks
if nothing has been received from the other socket and continues when
bytes are received, and <code>write</code> blocks if the recipient's
buffer is full and continues when it is not.<br>
<br>
Sockets are far simpler to code in Java because the classes encapsulate
many of the options that must be specified and the function calls and
structures that are needed when coding in C. &nbsp;Furthermore, the C
system calls are not safe and are difficult to debug because they
include several <code>enum</code> and <code>void*</code> arguments.<br>
<br>
<h2>2.&nbsp; Networking in Java</h2>
<h3>2.1 The package <code>java.net</code></h3>
The basic classes for implementing networked application are defined in
the package <code>java.net</code>.&nbsp; They include:<br>
<ul>
  <li><code>InetAddress</code> represents an internet host</li>
  <li><code>URL</code> represents a uniform resource locator</li>
  <li><code>Socket</code> represents a client socket used for
communication among processes on different hosts (TCP)</li>
  <li><code>ServerSocket</code> represents a server socket that listens
for client connections (TCP)</li>
  <li><code>DatagramSocket</code>, <code>MulticastSocket</code>, and <code>DatagramPacket</code>
for connectionless communication (UDP)</li>
  <li>Implementation classes and interfaces (e.g. <code>SocketImplFactory</code>,
    <code>SocketImpl</code>, and <code>SocketOptions</code>)</li>
  <li>Auxiliary URL and security classes (e.g., <code>URLConnection</code>,
    <code>URLDecoder</code>, and <code>SocketPermissions</code>)</li>
  <li>Exceptions (e.g., <code>UnknownHostException</code>, <code>MalformedURLException</code>,
and <code>SocketTimeoutException</code>)</li>
</ul>
Java 1.4 adds several classes such as <code>Inet6Address</code>, <code>URI</code>,
and <code>InetSocketAddress</code>.&nbsp; We covered <code>InetAddress</code>
above, and will discuss the socket classes in the next four sections.<br>
<br>
A URL consists of a protocol, a host name, a port, a path (usually to a
file), and a reference (sometimes called a "fragment").&nbsp; For
example, for the URL<br>
<code>http://www.cs.uic.edu:80/~i441/index.html#sockets</code>, <code>http</code>
is the protocol, <code>www.cs.uic.edu</code> is the host, <code>80</code>
is the port number, <code>~i441/index.html</code> is the path, and <code>sockets</code>
is the reference.&nbsp; The <code>URL</code> constructor takes a
string giving the URL, strings for the protocol, host, and file, three
strings and an <code>int</code> port, or a <code>URL</code> and a
string to be combined with it.&nbsp; The class defines the accessors <code>getProtocol</code>,
<code>getHost</code>, <code>getFile</code>, <code>getPort</code>, and
<code>getRef</code> for the components of the URL. The method <code>getContent</code>
attempts to determine the type of the URL's data (e.g., from the
filename extension or a "magic number") and returns the type <code>Object</code>,
e.g. a <code>String</code> for text or an <code>ImageProducer</code>
for an image.&nbsp; The method <code>openStream</code> returns an
input string from which the contents of the URL can be read.&nbsp; The
class <code>URL</code> also defines <code>equals</code>, <code>hashCode</code>,
and <code>toString</code>.<br>
<br>
<h3>2.2 The class <code>Socket</code></h3>
The class <code>java.net.Socket</code> represents an endpoint of a
connection-oriented protocol (i.e., a "client socket"). &nbsp;Its
constructor takes an <code> InetAddress</code> or a host name giving
the host and a port number, and can signal <code>UnknownHostException</code>,
<code>IOException</code>, and <code>SecurityException</code>. &nbsp;
(For C programmers, the constructor encapsulates the <code>socket</code>,
<code>connect</code>, and <code>inet_addr</code> function calls, and
the <code>gethostname</code> and <code>gethostbyname</code> calls
when
the string argument is a DNS name.) &nbsp;Client programs obtain an
instance by calling the constructor, while server programs obtain an
instance from <code>ServerSocket.accept</code>. &nbsp;
<code>Socket</code> defines accessors such as <code>getPort</code>
and <code>getInetAddress</code> (the remote port and host with which
the socket is communicating), <code> getLocalAddress</code> and
<code>getLocalPort</code>, and several that access the socket
configuration (e.g., <code>get/setSoTimeout</code>,
<code>get/setSoLinger</code>, and <code>get/setTcpNoDelay</code>).
&nbsp;The method <code>close</code> closes the socket. &nbsp;
The methods <code>getInputStream</code> and <code>getOutputStream</code>
return streams that can be used to send and receive data. &nbsp;
The server and client programs can filter the streams returned by
the sockets to use readers and writers for text data or object
streams for transmitting serialized objects, or to compress and
uncompress the messages. &nbsp;Examples are presented below.<br>
<br>
<h3>2.3 The class <code>ServerSocket</code></h3>
The class <code>java.net.ServerSocket</code> represents sockets that
listen for connection requests. &nbsp;The constructor takes a port
number
and an optional queue length. &nbsp;If the port number is 0, the
operating system assigns a port number, in which case, the program uses
<code>getLocalPort</code> to obtain the port number. &nbsp;(For C
programmers, the constructor encapsulates the <code>socket</code>, <code>bind</code>
, and <code>listen</code> function calls.)&nbsp; The default queue
length for the number of pending connections that the operating system
will maintain is 50.&nbsp; The constructor can also take an <code>InetAddress</code>
to support hosts that have multiple network interfaces with different
IP numbers. &nbsp;The method <code>accept</code> waits for a client to
connect and &nbsp;returns a socket representing the connection with the
client. &nbsp;The method <code> close</code> closes the socket, and
the class provides accessors such as <code>getInetAddress</code>,
<code>getLocalPort</code>, <code>getSoTimeout</code>, <code>setSoTimeout</code>,
and <code>isClosed</code>. &nbsp;The constructor, <code>accept</code>,
and <code>close</code> can signal <code>IOException</code>, and the
constructor signals <code>SecurityException</code> if the server
cannot be bound to the given port number.<br>
<br>
The platform-specific implementation of instances of <code>ServerSocket</code>
and <code>Socket</code> is encapsulated in a subclass of the abstract
class <code>SocketImpl</code>.&nbsp; Both classes define the class
method <code> setSocketFactory</code>, which takes a <code>SocketImplFactory</code>
.&nbsp; For example, we could define a socket implementation that
connects via a proxy or goes
through a firewall.<br>
<br>
<h3>2.4 Connection-oriented communication</h3>
The server creates a <code>ServerSocket</code> to accept connections
and calls <code>ServerSocket.accept</code> to wait for a connection
and
obtain a socket connected to a client. &nbsp;It obtains input and
output
streams from the socket, and uses them to write and read data.
&nbsp;The
following is a skeleton for a server class:<br>
<br>
<code>import java.io.*;<br>
import java.net.*;<br>
<br>
public class Server extends Thread &nbsp;{<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;public static final int PORT_NUMBER = 12345;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;protected Socket socket;<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;public static void main(String[] args) {<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ServerSocket server = null;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; try {<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;server = new
ServerSocket(PORT_NUMBER);<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;while (true) {<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; new Server(server.accept());<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;}<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; }<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; catch(IOException ex) {<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;System.out.println(&#8220;Unable to start
server or accept connections&#8221;);<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;System.exit(1);<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; }<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; finally {<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;try {<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; server.close()<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;}<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;catch(IOException ex) {<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; // not much can be done: log
the error<br>
</code><code>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; // exits since
this is the end of main<br>
</code><code>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; }<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; }<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;}<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;private Server(Socket socket) {<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; this.socket = socket;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; start();<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;}<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;// the server services client requests in the run method<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;public void run() {<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; InputStream in = null;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; OutputStream out = null;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; try {<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;in = socket.getInputStream();<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;out = socket.getOutputStream();<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;// ... do useful stuff ...<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; }<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; catch(IOException ex) {<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;System.out.println(&#8220;Unable to get
streams from client&#8221;);<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; }<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; finally {<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;try {<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in.close();<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; out.close();<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; socket.close();<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;}<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;catch(IOException ex) {<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; // not much can be done: log
the error<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; }</code><code><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; }<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;}<br>
}<br>
</code><br>
Since the server is a process running on the host, it needs a <code>main</code>
method which is executed from the command line.&nbsp; (A server usually
does not have a graphic user interface because it runs in the
background.)
&nbsp;The class <code>Server</code> extends <code>Thread</code> so
that it can start a new thread for each client that connects and
then continue to accept connections.&nbsp; It uses a server socket
and client sockets, rather than extending these classes. &nbsp;
<code>serv.accept</code> blocks waiting for a connection request and
returns a client socket for communicating with the client, and is
usually called in an endless loop as in this example. &nbsp;
In this case, the server program never exits so you must use the
operating system &#8220;kill&#8221; command to stop it. &nbsp;The client socket is
passed to the constructor so that it is available in <code>run</code>.
&nbsp;The constructor sets the socket for communicating with the client
and starts a thread for that connection. &nbsp;Note that <code>start</code>
returns without waiting for the thread's <code>run</code> method to
finish,
so the server re-enters the <code>accept</code> loop concurrently.
&nbsp;
<code> main</code> must handle all exceptions.<br>
<br>
The <code>run</code> method for a server class is usually a loop that
gets a command from the client, computes or accesses the requested
information, and returns it to the client.&nbsp; Typically, there is a
client command that breaks out of the loop, at which point the server
closes the connection.&nbsp; For example, a server that echoes the
client text would do the following
(at &#8220;<code>&#8230; do useful stuff ...</code> &#8221; in the above example):<br>
<br>
<code>&nbsp; &nbsp;BufferedReader inReader = new BufferedReader(new
InputStreamReader(in));<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;// the constructor argument &#8220;true&#8221; enables auto-flushing<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;PrintWriter outWriter = new PrintWriter(out, true);<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;outWriter.println(&#8220;Echo server: enter &#8216;bye&#8217; to exit.&#8221;);<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;while (true) {<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; // readLine blocks until a line-terminated string
is available<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;String inLine = inReader.readLine();<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;// readLine returns null if the client just
presses &lt;return&gt;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;if (inLine != null) {<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; if
(inLine.trim().equalsIgnoreCase(&#8220;bye&#8221;)) {<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;break;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; }<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; outWriter.println(&#8220;Echo: &#8220; + inLine);<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; }<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;}</code><br>
<br>
The server sends a prompt to the client which it prints to standard
output.&nbsp; The client reads a line from standard input and sends it
to the server, which checks whether it is the exit command and if not,
sends it back to the client prepended with <code>Echo: </code>.&nbsp;
The client then prints this response.<br>
<br>
The client is also a separate process and need a <code>main</code>
method. &nbsp;The client creates a <code>Socket</code> by passing the
server&#8217;s
host name and port number to the constructor, and uses it to
communicate
with the server. &nbsp;The constructor invocation attempts to establish
a connection with the given host and port, and blocks until the
connection
is established.&nbsp; If the server process cannot be contacted or
refuses the connection, an exception is signaled.&nbsp; Like the
server's <code>run</code> method, the client program
obtains streams from the socket.&nbsp; The following skeletal client
program takes the server name from the command line.&nbsp; To simplify
the example, we
have omitted the code that checks the number of command line arguments.
&nbsp;(A client could also be defined as an applet that creates the
socket in <code>
init</code> .)<br>
<br>
<code>import java.io.*;<br>
import java.net.*;<br>
<br>
public class Client {<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;public static void main(String args[]) {<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; new Client(args[0]);<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;}<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;public Client(String host) {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Socket socket;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; try {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; socket = new Socket(host,
Server.PORT_NUMBER);<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; }<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; catch(UnknownHostException
ex) {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; System.out.println(host + " is
not a valid host name.");<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;return;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; }<br>
</code><code> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; catch(IOException
ex) {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; System.out.println(&#8220;Error
communicating with &#8221; + host);<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;return;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; }</code><code><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; // &#8230; initialize model, GUI, etc. ...<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; InputStream in = null;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; OutputStream out = null;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; try {<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;in = socket.getInputStream();<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;out = socket.getOutputStream();<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;// ... do useful stuff ...<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; }<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; finally {<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;try {<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in.close();<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; out.close();<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; socket.close();<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;}<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;catch(IOException ex) {<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; // not much can be done ...<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;}<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; } <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;}<br>
}<br>
</code><br>
Note that the port number passed to the <code>Socket</code>
constructor is the server port number. &nbsp;The client's port number
is assigned by the operating system and is available via <code>getLocalPort</code>.
&nbsp;In this simple example, the client exits if it cannot connect
with a server. &nbsp;Since the exception raised by attempting to
connect might be due to a temporary condition such as the size of the
server's connection request queue, we usually code the invocation of
the <code>Socket</code> constructor in a loop that sleeps a few
seconds and tries to connect again, with a counter that limits the
number of connection attempts.<br>
<br>
To test a client-server program without using another machine, you can
run both processes on the same computer and have the client use the
special &#8220;local loopback address&#8221; 127.0.0.1, which denotes the local
machine.&nbsp; Even though it is a local connection, this method still
requires that
you have networking software running on your machine.<br>
<br>
<h3>2.5 Connectionless communication</h3>
<code>java.net</code> also provides classes for connectionless
communication: both the server and client create a <code>
DatagramSocket</code>.
&nbsp;The constructor takes an optional port number, and the methods
<code>send</code> and <code>receive</code> send and receive the
argument <code> DatagramPacket</code> . &nbsp;Like <code>Socket</code>,
<code> DatagramSocket</code> provides accessors such as <code>getLocalAddress</code>
, <code>getLocalPort</code> , <code>getSoTimeout</code> , and
<code> close</code> closes the socket. &nbsp;Both the server and client
create <code>DatagramPacket</code> instances to contain the data
transmitted. &nbsp;The constructor for a received packet takes a byte
array for the data and the packet length, while the constructor for
a packet to send takes the byte array data, the packet length, and the
destination address and port. &nbsp;<code> DatagramPacket</code>
provides the accessors <code>get/setAddress</code>, <code>get/setPort</code>,
<code>get/setLength</code>, and <code>get/setData</code>.<br>
