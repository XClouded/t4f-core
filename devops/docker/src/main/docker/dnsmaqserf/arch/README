Serf/Dnsmasq on Docker
----------------------

This image aims to provide resolvable fully qualified domain names,
between dynamically created docker containers on ubuntu.

The problem
-----------

By default **/etc/hosts** is readonly in docker containers. The usual
solution is to start a DNS server (probably as a docker container) and pass
a reference when starting docker instances: `docker run -dns <IP_OF_DNS>`
